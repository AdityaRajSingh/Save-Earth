<h2>Monitoring Social Media for Disaster Detection and Management</h2>
<br>
Increasing use of social media is prooving handy to detect and analyse weather changes, disasters and calamities. Natural disasters that have occured in the past, have shown that social media is helpful in relief work and in some cases even prediction of disaster. The idea is to efficiently monitor social media and detect, notify and spread information during disasters.

Twitter May Be Faster Than FEMA Models for Tracking Disaster Damage
Qualitative, quantitative and behavioural research suggests that social media has come as handy and of great service during natural disasters
<br>
<h2>How Does it Work</h2>
<br>
Social media websites provide APIs which provide valuable data to monitor, detect and manage disasters.

APIs will be used to monitor real-time tweets or posts, their geographic location and timestamp, filtered by relevant tags or keywords. We will be using DIP and NLP to understand the context of images and the related emotion.The algorithm will analyse its authencity by monitoring other tweets or posts in the area.

Alert notification will be sent to users, NGOs and local authorities for immediate action. People can seek help from the nearby authorities and NGOs in the disaster-affected area via our app or website by pressing the SOS button and providing details if possible.

Details of the NGOs present in the affected location will be highlighted to facilitate donation.
