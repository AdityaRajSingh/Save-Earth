## **How Does it Work**

Social media websites provide APIs which provide valuable data to monitor, detect and manage disasters.

APIs will be used to monitor real-time tweets or posts, their geographic location and timestamp, filtered by relevant tags or keywords. We will be using Sentiment Analysis for weight.

Alert notification will be sent to users, for immediate action. People can also report a disaster.

Details of the NGOs present in the affected location will be highlighted to facilitate donation.
