## **Introduction**


Increasing use of social media is prooving handy to detect and analyse weather changes, disasters and calamities. Natural disasters that have occured in the past, have shown that social media is helpful in relief work and in some cases even prediction of disaster. The idea is to efficiently monitor social media and detect, notify and spread information during disasters.

## **How Does it Work**

Social media websites provide APIs which provide valuable data to monitor, detect and manage disasters.

APIs will be used to monitor real-time tweets or posts, their geographic location and timestamp, filtered by relevant tags or keywords. We will be using Sentiment Analysis for weight.

Alert notification will be sent to users, for immediate action. People can also report a disaster.

Details of the NGOs present in the affected location will be highlighted to facilitate donation.
